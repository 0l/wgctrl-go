// Package wireguardctrl provides unified access to WireGuard devices for both
// Linux kernel and userspace WireGuard implementations.
//
// Users are encouraged to use this package directly, rather than wireguardnl or
// wireguardcfg, as it provides an abstracted interface that works on both
// Linux and non-Linux operating systems.
//
// For more information on WireGuard, please see https://www.wireguard.com/.
